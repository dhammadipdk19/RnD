FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n","  loadnet = torch.load(model_path, map_location=torch.device('cpu'))\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define output directories\n","train_output_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Machine Learning Lab/Project/CIFAR10_train'\n","test_output_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Machine Learning Lab/Project/CIFAR10_test'\n","os.makedirs(train_output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n","os.makedirs(test_output_dir, exist_ok=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"95Gyc3Tp9dGB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731827524939,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":459,"user":{"displayName":"DHAMMADIP MAHENDRA KAMBLE","userId":"18054280921647504852"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def process_dataset(dataset, output_dir):\n","    \"\"\"Process CIFAR-10 dataset and save enhanced images.\"\"\"\n","    for idx, (image_tensor, label) in enumerate(tqdm(dataset, desc=f\"Processing {output_dir}\")):\n","        image = transforms.ToPILImage()(image_tensor)\n","\n","        # Convert PIL image to OpenCV format (BGR)\n","        input_img = np.array(image)\n","        input_img_bgr = input_img[:, :, ::-1]  # Convert RGB to BGR for OpenCV\n","\n","        # Enhance the image\n","        with torch.no_grad():\n","            try:\n","                output_img_bgr, _ = upscaler.enhance(input_img_bgr, outscale=8)\n","                output_img_bgr = cv2.resize(output_img_bgr, (224, 224), interpolation=cv2.INTER_LANCZOS4)\n","            except Exception as e:\n","                print(f\"Error processing image {idx}: {e}\")\n","                continue\n","\n","        # Convert to RGB and save as PIL image\n","        output_img_rgb = output_img_bgr[:, :, ::-1]  # Convert BGR back to RGB\n","        output_image_pil = Image.fromarray(output_img_rgb)\n","\n","        # Save the enhanced image in the corresponding label folder\n","        label_dir = os.path.join(output_dir, str(label))\n","        os.makedirs(label_dir, exist_ok=True)\n","        output_image_pil.save(os.path.join(label_dir, f\"{idx}.png\"))\n","\n","# Process and save CIFAR-10 train and test datasets\n","process_dataset(cifar10_train, train_output_dir)\n","process_dataset(cifar10_test, test_output_dir)\n","\n","print(\"Enhanced CIFAR-10 dataset creation complete!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"kJI7x39Q9uDD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731832597172,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5050492,"user":{"displayName":"DHAMMADIP MAHENDRA KAMBLE","userId":"18054280921647504852"}},"outputId":"d8bac3bc-ec4f-455d-e000-957a05856221"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Processing /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Machine Learning Lab/Project/CIFAR10_train: 100%|██████████| 50000/50000 [1:10:03<00:00, 11.89it/s]\n","Processing /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Machine Learning Lab/Project/CIFAR10_test: 100%|██████████| 10000/10000 [14:06<00:00, 11.82it/s]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enhanced CIFAR-10 dataset creation complete!\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Z-3gZgsF9zeH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
